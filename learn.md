# Overview
Hi, Welcome to the Wonderous World of Markdowns. I am Aditya Bhusal ***a learner***. *(Yes I copied the intro from *Anthony Padilla*.)* Markdown is a quick **markup language**  for formatting text. It was first introduced by ***John Gruber*** in 2004.
What good is a progress without proper documentation so learning about the md file and markup language is very important for every learning phase and its documentation. 

> Before proceeding with the syntax and keywords, if any of the syntax doesn't work: Try adding space after the keywords and syntaxes. Of course the proper guideline will be provided but I can be wrong.

## Basic Syntax:
``#`` - 1 hashtag works as same as a h1 tag in html

``##`` - 2 hashtags works as same as a h2 tag in html. It is smaller in size than the text with 1 hashtag.

Similarly it works for all preceeding hashtags and numbers of hastags one example will give you a clear example.

### Example:
``` md
# Text
## Text
### Text
#### Text
###### Text
```

# Text
## Text
### Text
#### Text
###### Text

## Block of Code
``` md
 * Use ``` symbols followed by name of the programming language you want to write the code in. 
 For Example:
 > ``` python
   print("Hi there")
 > ```
 discard the > symbol in above example.
```
## Tables
<!-- tables -->
<!-- Note that :---: means center aligned -->
<!-- Note that ---: means right aligned -->
<!-- Note that :--- means left aligned -->

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| :--- | :--: | --: |
| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 | Row 1, Column 3 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 | Row 2, Column 3 |
| Row 3, Column 1 | Row 3, Column 2 | Row 3, Column 3 |
```md

:---: means center aligned 
---: means right aligned 
:--- means left aligned 

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| :--- | :--: | --: | <!-- this row is required for the alignment of the elements and heading in the respective column. -->
| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 | Row 1, Column 3 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 | Row 2, Column 3 |
| Row 3, Column 1 | Row 3, Column 2 | Row 3, Column 3 |

```
```md
>This is how quotes are written.  -Name of author
```
>This is how quotes are written.  -Name of author

Everything else is similar to html as both are markup languages md and html can be interchanged with online tools easily. If you have any question you can contact me directly.
